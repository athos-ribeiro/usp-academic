This paper presents an empirical study on the evolution of the Linux project.
Based on static analysis data, we propose a low-complexity statistical model to
study flaws in the Linux source code. 391 versions of the project were analyzed
by mining the official Linux repository, using an approach that can be
reproduced to perform similar studies.
