Due to the constant evolution of technology, each day brings new
programming languages, development paradigms, and ways of evaluating
processes. This is no different with source code metrics, where there
is always new metric classes. To use a software metric to support
decisions, it is necessary to understand how to perform the metric
collection, calculation, interpretation, and analysis. The tasks of
collecting and calculating source code metrics are most often
automated, but how should we monitor them during the software
development cycle? Our research aims to assist the software engineer
to monitor metrics of vulnerability threats present in the source code
through a reference prediction model, considering that real world
software have non-functional security requirements, which implies the
need to know how to monitor these requirements during the software
development cycle. As a first result, this paper presents an empirical
study on the evolution of the Linux project. Based on static analysis
data, we propose low complexity models to study flaws in the Linux
source code. About 391 versions of the project were analyzed by mining
the official Linux repository using an approach that can be reproduced
to perform similar studies. Our results show that it is possible to
predict the number of warnings triggered by a static analyzer for a
given software project revision as long as the software is
continuously monitored.
