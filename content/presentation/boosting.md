On this presentation, held on September 4th, 2017, during the Software
Systems Laboratory weekly meeting in IME-USP, I introduced Ensenble
Learning methods and Boosting algorithms to the group and talked about how I am using such algorithms to learn how to rank static analyzers reports in [kiskadee](pagure.io/kiskadee).
