This semester I am taking an [Object Oriented Programming](https://uspdigital.usp.br/janus/componente/catalogoDisciplinasInicial.jsf?action=3&sgldis=MAC5714) class and one of our assignments is to prepare a presentation on some related topic.

In this presentation, [Arthur Del Esposte](http://www.ime.usp.br/~arthurmde) and I introduce the importance of testing software and applying good release and reliability engineering techniques in software projects.

You can download the slides for this presentation [here](http://www.ime.usp.br/~athoscr/files/devops_intro.pdf)
